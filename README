This is an Andriod application that is built to allow a woman to time her contractions leading up to the birth of her child.
It's a very basic featured application currently and was used to demo at the Twin Cities Java User's group by its creator Justin Grammens of Localtone, LLC.

Feel free to learn, fork, enhance and improve. There are a few different additional features that I'm planning to add as time goes on.

Thanks,
Justin
