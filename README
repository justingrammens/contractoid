This is an Andriod application that is built to allow a woman to time her contractions leading up to the birth of her child.
It's a very basc featured application currently and was demos at the Twin Cities Java User's group by it's creator Justin Grammens of Localtone, LLC.

Feel free to lear from, fork, enhance and improve. There are a few different additional features that I'll be adding as time goes on.

Thanks,
Justin
